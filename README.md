# Tiny Raytracer

![Output Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awhb/tinyraytracer/main/out.jpg)

A simple Ray Tracing program written in bare C++ following a [tutorial](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer). By doing this, I learned a lot about C++, linear algebra and even the physics of light! Recommend to check it out and implement if you are interested. 

# Compilation
```
cd tinyraytracer
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
