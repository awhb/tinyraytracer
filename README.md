# Tiny Raytracer

A simple ray tracing program written in C++ following a [tutorial](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer). By doing this, I refreshed a lot of my knowledge on linear algebra and even the physics of light! Recommend to check it out and implement if you are interested. 

# Compilation
```
cd tinyraytracer
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
